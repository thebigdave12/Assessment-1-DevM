// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "In the second step, more research is performed and at the end an analysis is performed to check for the feasibility of the project is performed. If everything checks out, the team will move onto step 3."
const design = "In the third step, the team designs the software using psuedo code, documents, guidlines (no actual coding) going over and creating the proper steps to help make the coding process as efficient as possible."
const implementation = "In the fourth step, the coding finally starts. Developers stick to the design plans/blueprint to build the desired goal"
const testingAndIntegration = "In the fifth step, the team tests the built code to see if it accomplishes the initial goal and defined requirements. Teams will also test/look for any defects or deficiencies, fixing anything hampering the code."
const maintain = "Although the code has been deployed and functional, the maintain puts in the proper steps to make sure the code continues to be operational and efficient. This means that teams will optimize, monitor and even review exsisting code, so that the end solution can be fixed/improved"
